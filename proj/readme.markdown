# n2cms.com 2.0 #
Easier, concise, updated.

## Site goals ##
Present (what N2 is), direct (to download), explain (how to use N2), offer services

## Design goals ##
Light, "technical", works with little imagery

## Communication goals ##
Focus is presentation of the CMS, download, documentation. Proposals have many good ideas (too many, needs to be less for first version). This will evolve.

## Features & priority ##
1. Nice layout
2. Start page
3. Nice article page w. tagging
4. Easy to write documenatation w. tagging, code & images. Easy how? (markdown+github = import/export or git integration)
5. Showcase/blog
6. A nice introductory page (presents features, code snippets, downloads)
7. Feature comparison table
8. Mobile version
9. Codeplex forum integration

## Layout spikes ##
