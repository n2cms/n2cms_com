## n2cms.com 2.0 ##
Easier, concise, updated.

* _Site goals:_ Present (what N2 is), direct (to download), explain (how to use N2), offer services. 
* _Design goals:_ Light, "technical", works with little imagery.
* _Communication goals:_ Focus is presentation of the CMS, download, documentation. Proposals have many good ideas (too many, needs to be less for first version). This will evolve.

### Features & priority ###
1. Nice layout
2. Start page
3. Nice article page w. tagging
4. Easy to write documenatation w. tagging, code & images. Easy how? (markdown+github = import/export or git integration)
5. Showcase/blog
6. A nice introductory page (presents features, code snippets, downloads)
7. Feature comparison table
8. Mobile version
9. Codeplex forum integration

## Site map ##

### 1. Start page ###
What to feature here?

### 2. Features ###
Feature overview, content on current site. Which items do we want to preserve in the current list?  Any new items to add?

N2 Core Engine

### 3. Screenshots of admin UI ###
Showcase drag & drop. Maybe provide some videos.

### 4. Download ###
* Link to Nuget.org packages
* Link to Github Releases for bleeding edge packages
* Link to Partners page 

Do we want to use the Github Releases functionality? Or CodePlex (which gives us download stats)? NuGet gives us download stats :smile:

### 5. Documentation ###
Right now the documentation is at http://n2cmsdocs.atlassian.net/ -- do we want to move this over? 

Probably best to keep them in Confluence for now and eventually move over to the N2 website. Need better model for community contribution to docs which Confluence currently provides. N2 wiki functionality isn't up to par :frown:

### 6. Partners ###

Hosting options
* Ben can provide hosting through Elix Technologies (USA).  Custom designed plans for N2 with plenty of RAM and inclusive of 1 hr/month of consulting time? Need to update the Elixtech.com website though.
* EU hosted plans?
* Hosting benefits N2CMS development somehow?

Web design partnerships
* List of firms offering N2 DEV support in various regions -- US, EU, etc. 
* Benefits N2CMS somehow? Can we hire back Cristian to do further updates to N2 to meet customer needs?
